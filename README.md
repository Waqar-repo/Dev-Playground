# Dev-Playground 🛠️

Welcome to **Dev-Playground** — my personal sandbox for learning, experimenting, and building! This repository is a living space where I test out new ideas, practice concepts, and explore different tools, technologies, and coding paradigms.

## 🚀 Purpose

This repo exists as a safe space for:

- 🔍 Exploring new programming languages, frameworks, and libraries
- 🧪 Testing prototypes or snippets
- 💡 Practicing algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving
- 🧰 Setting up boilerplates or reusable templates
- 📚 Documenting what I learn along the way

## 📂 Structure

You might find:
/experiments/ → New tech, APIs, frameworks, etc.
/snippets/ → Handy reusable code bits
/notes/ → Learning notes, docs, or references
README.md → You're reading it 🙂

⚠️ **Note:** The structure might evolve as I go. Things may break, move, or get messy — and that’s okay. This is a *playground*, after all.

## 🧠 Topics I Explore

- JavaScript / TypeScript
- React / Next.js / Node.js
- Python & Scripting
- Anything else that catches my curiosity

## 📌 Disclaimer

This is not a production-ready repository. It’s primarily for personal learning and experimentation. Contributions aren’t expected — but you're welcome to explore, fork, or learn from it if you find something useful.
