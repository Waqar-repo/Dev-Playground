    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <h2>About me </h2> <h3> I am waqar Ahmad and I am going to be web developer</h3>
    <p>Hi! I’m a web developer and I love all things tech. When I’m not knee-deep in code, I’m probably reading up on
        the latest development trends or practicing my sketching (or both). 
        I got my start in technology as a self-taught coder, and since then I’ve never looked back. 
        I specialize in front-end development, but I have a
        little bit of experience with everything from coding to QA to project management. I’m always looking for new
        challenges and opportunities, and I’m excited to see what the future holds for me in the world of tech. Thanks
        for reading!</p>
